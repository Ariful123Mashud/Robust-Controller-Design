A Multivariable Super Twisting Sliding Mode Control of Descriptor Systems
This paper deals with the control of Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) descriptor system using multivariable super-twisting sliding mode control scheme subjected to unknown bounded disturbances. Based on certain conditions, a descriptor system can be represented in generalized regular canonical form which makes the design procedure systematic as a normal system. A step wise method is shown to calculate the appropriate sliding surface gain matrix which can asymptotically stabilize the reduced order system. A design of multivariate super twisting sliding mode control scheme is introduced which eliminates the need to have the derivative of sliding surfaces with a smooth control action. Finally an example is simulated to validate the proposed design.
